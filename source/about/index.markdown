## Who is Fabio Cognigni?

I am a Software Engineer passionate about combining Open Source technologies, Agile methodologies and technical best practices to deliver high quality software.

I love being driven by curiosity, "thinking outside of the box" and explore new solutions and technologies.

Key drivers of my work are: clean architecture design, quality of code, automated processes, systems visibility and measurability.
