Many times (too many!) the happiness of having delivered a project in time (or even ahead of time!) get immediately replaced by the bitter sensation of realizing that you don't have enough visibility on this new system and also users have not enough documentation to be able to use it in autonomy.

I'm sure everyone can feel the pain of spending days in writing documentation or coding just logging and metrics recording.
In addition to that most of the time the results are not that great just because you forgot all the details about why you did a certain implementation choice, edge cases and caveats.

This is why we started including logging (TODO: link to logging post!!!), metrics recording and documentation (swagger or any other form of documentation) as integral part of playing a story of the team wall.

So basically the process is something like this:
1. pick a new story from the team wall
.....
10. move the story to "dev complete".
